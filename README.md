# Zoomiverse
Zoomiverse is an interactive web app that lets users explore high-resolution NASA images. You can zoom into galaxies, planets, and Earth, add pins with notes, and save or export your annotations. Built with OpenSeadragon, itâ€™s a prototype for NASA Space Apps to make space imagery more accessible and engaging.
